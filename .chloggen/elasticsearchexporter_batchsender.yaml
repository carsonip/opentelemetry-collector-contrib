  Move buffering from bulk indexer to batch sender to improve reliability.
  With this change, there should be no event loss when used with persistent queue in the event of a collector crash.
  Introduce `batcher.*` to configure the batch sender which is now enabled by default.
  Option `flush.bytes` is deprecated. Use the new `batcher.min_size_items` option to control the minimum number of items (log records, spans) to trigger a flush. `batcher.min_size_items` will be set to the value of `flush.bytes` / 1000 if `flush.bytes` is non-zero.
  Option `flush.interval` is deprecated. Use the new `batcher.flush_timeout` option to control max age of buffer. `batcher.flush_timeout` will be set to the value of `flush.interval` if `flush.interval` is non-zero.
  Queue sender `sending_queue.enabled` defaults to `true`.
